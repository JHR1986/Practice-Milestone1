# Roche Fitness

## Gym Website

[View the Live Website Here](#)

This project comprises the development of a 6 page website for a fictional recently opened gym called Roche Fitness, which is located in Deansgrange Business Park in South Dublin. 
The website has 6 separate pages to outline what the services provided by the gym (Home, About, Facilities, Classes, Join & Info), and an Enquiry Form and Classes Schedule (PDF) accessed through call to action buttons.
The main aim of this website is to provide (i) an overview of the gym to potential customers, prior to them being able to make an Enquiry about Membership, and (ii) important information for Current Members in order that they can avail of all of the gym's services.   
In respect of the construction of the website, it has been designed to be fully responsive, intuitive and accessible on a range of media devices, in order to make it easy for current and prospective members to navigate the site and source information.

# User Experience (UX)
## User stories:

### First Time Visitor Goals
1. As a First Time Visitor, I want to quickly establish what services the gym offers and what is the process for enquiring about joining as a member. 
2. As a First Time Visitor, I want to be able to easily navigate throughout the site pages and find key information about the location of the gym and contact details (email & phone) for enquiries.
3. As a First Time Visitor, I want to view testimonials from gym members to understand how current members view the services available and whether the gym would suit me to apply.

### Returning Visitor Goals
1. As a Returning Visitor/Potential Member, I want to locate information about new classes or updated facilities since my last visit to the site.
2. As a Returning Visitor/Potential Member, I want to find the best way to get in contact with the gym with any additional questions I may have.
3. As a Returning Visitor/Potential Member, I want to be able to easily access the key information in respect of opening hours and access to the gym car park.

### Frequent User Goals
1. As a Frequent User/Current Member, I want to check to see what time the free group workout classes are on each week.
2. As a Frequent User/Current Member, I want to check to see if there are any new or upgraded membership options (with added benefits).
3. As a Frequent User/Current Member, I want to confirm if opening hours have been amended or contact the gym with specific enquiries (e.g. is gym open on a bank holiday)

## Design:

### Colour Scheme
- In line with the Bootstrap dark theme, the site generally has dark colour with varying shades of (i) black, (ii) fuschia, (iii) red and (iv) pink being used for the wording (and being set against a white background colour). 
  These colours were used to match the logo that I created for the gym. When selecting the images and background images, I selected dark tones in order that the white and pink text would be easily visible in front of them, and so that they would match the design of the Navbar and Footer. 

- The colours that I used for the website are detailed in the colour chart below which I prepared on coolors.co;

### Typography
- The Roboto font is the main font used throughout the whole website with Sans Serif as the fallback font in case for any reason the font fails to be imported into the site correctly. Roboto has a dual nature. It has a mechanical skeleton and the forms are largely geometric. At the same time, the font features friendly and open curves.

### Imagery
- The imagery within the website is important. The large, background hero image on the Home Page of the woman weightlifting is designed to be striking and catch the user's attention. I used several large images of people working out to establish the fitness aspect of the gym. There are three hero images throughout the site. 

### Wireframes
- All my wireframes are saved to PDF and can be found [here](#). The wireframes stayed generally consistent with the finished design, however I retained the NavBar list for iPad and the membership options are now listed on one line.  

## Features
- The website is responsive on all device sizes (and has been tested through Google Dev Tools on iPhone6, iPhoneX, iPad and Desktop).
- The website has several interactive elements, including bootstrap buttons which can be clicked to open up an Enquiry Form and a Class Schedule.
